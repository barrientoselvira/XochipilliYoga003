  <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        Hello world,
        <p>
        Thanks for visiting my yoga site. It's the place, on the world wide web, where I've combined two of my joys: coding and yoga.
        My yoga journey began, in my late teens, when I came across a Yoga for Fitness dvd. It was the best thing that could have happened to this, self proclaimed, fitness and philosophy junkie. College came into play, I took a yoga class as an elective, got my associates in Psychology and I decided to hit the road in 2011 on a lark.
        <p>
        Thankfully, I found a donation based studio called Blackswan Yoga, it was there that I began practicing almost on the daily. My love for the practice gained momemtum. I began integrating Buddhism into my practice, became a vegetarian and, most importantly, my love for myself grew.
        <p>
        Flash forward to 2016 and I obtained my Vinyasa Yoga certification from Yoga Yoga. And now, we're here. I'd love for you to flow with me in one of my outdoor Vinyasa sessions. You've got nothing to lose. Plus, you'll be gaining some peace of mind.
<p>
Godspeed,
<p>
Elvira
<p>
PS I've coded this website on my own.
